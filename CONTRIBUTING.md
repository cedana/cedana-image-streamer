## Contributing to cedana-image-streamer

Changes in cedana-image-streamer may depend on changes in cedana daemon. To
pass PR CI tests, the `CEDANA_DAEMON_BRANCH` repository variable may need to be
changed. Ensure you have write access or ask someone who does to change this
variable such that tests can pass in your branch.
