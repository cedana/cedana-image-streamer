// The serialized image is received via multiple data streams (`Shard`). The data streams are
// comprised of markers followed by an optional data payload. The format of the markers is
// described in ../proto/image.proto.
// Each marker has a sequence number providing a reassembly order (produced in capture.rs).
// At any point in time, a given shard has the marker that should be processed next.
// We represent this with a PendingMarker. Reassembling the stream of markers provides the
// original image files.
//
// When extracting the image, we either store the image files in memory, or write them on disk.
// The former is useful when streaming to client directly, the latter is useful to extract an image
// on disk.
//
// Streaming to client is done by buffering the entire image in memory, and let client consume it.
// XXX Performance isn't that great due to the memory copy in our address space. To improve
// performance, we could splice() shard pipe data to client directly. This is difficult as client
// doesn't read the image files in the same order as they are produced. For example, inventory.img
// is written last in the image, but is read first. One way to go around this issue is to reserve
// a shard during capture for all small image files (pretty much all except pages, ghost files, and
// fs.tar). In addition, we might have to rewrite some part of client to restore these large files in
// the same order as they were produced. It might be difficult to preserve this guarantee forever,
// so it would be wise to keep our in-memory buffering implementation anyways.
